// An owl sat alone on the branch of a tree

// And she was as quiet as quiet could be
// Twas night and her eyes were wide open like this

// She looked all around, not a thing did she miss
// Some little birds perched on the branch of the tree

// And they were as quiet as quiet could be
// The solemn old owl said, "Whoo-whoo-whoo"
// And up jumped the birds and away they all flew
